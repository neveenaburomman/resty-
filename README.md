# REST-app
 In this lab we start to build our first phase of a 4-Phase build of the RESTy application . In this  phase, our goal is to setup the basic and the file structure of the application, and we will add more functionality to the app as we go. 
 ## phase-2 
 in this phase we  used the useState() hook in our functional components , the user will be enters an API URL and Chooses one of the method
and when clicks the “Go” button our app fetches data from the URL , with the method we have chosen and we will be able to see the result .
